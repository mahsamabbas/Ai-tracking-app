## Conclusion

Techlio is a working local Phase 1–2 prototype. It has not completed the PRD
Definition of Done because Phase 0 human gates, the seven-day pilot, and most
Phase 3 production controls remain open.

## Phase 0 — partial

Implemented:

- Claude Code is the named first Tier A target.
- Claude hooks, connector ingestion, a capability matrix, and an integration ADR
  exist.
- The collection notice, allowed metadata, exclusions, retention proposal,
  pause behavior, and open decisions are documented.

Still required:

- Run and record one real sanitized Claude Code pilot session.
- Confirm actual hook, OTel, token, licensing, and operating-system coverage.
- Obtain legal/HR approval for notice, retention, access, pause, dispute, client
  confidentiality, jurisdiction, and cross-border rules.
- Keep unsupported metrics marked unavailable; do not estimate them.

## Phase 1 — substantially implemented, not complete

Implemented:

- Admin-issued, revocable connector credentials bound to an employee and tool.
- Developer activation with explicit collection-notice acknowledgement.
- Ed25519 public-key binding and signed event-batch verification.
- Strict allowlist event schema, local redaction, and server secret rejection.
- AES-256-GCM SQLite queue with peek/ack at-least-once delivery semantics.
- Heartbeat, queue depth, pause state, normalized ingestion, idempotent event IDs,
  sessionization, idle handling, coverage events, and connector-health UI.
- Unit tests for schema, redaction, queue acknowledgement, signing, interval
  merging, idle handling, and connector state.

Still required:

- Add a durable server-side ingestion queue if direct Postgres ingestion is not
  accepted as the durability boundary.
- Add live integration tests for offline recovery, heartbeat stop, pause,
  late-event recalculation, invalid signature, and replay through the API.
- Persist connector-reported capability declarations rather than relying only
  on the static catalog.
- Emit and alert on repeated upload failures and unsupported connector versions.

Provider truth:

- Claude Code hooks are the only credible Tier A implementation.
- Cursor currently supplies companion file/task signals and optional daily Admin
  API aggregates; it does not expose Cursor's internal model/tool stream.
- Codex and Gemini adapters are planned, not implemented. Their OTLP routes now
  reject with `501` instead of silently discarding telemetry.
- GitHub Copilot is daily aggregate telemetry when enterprise credentials exist.

## Phase 2 — partial

Implemented:

- Organization overview, employee directory, employee/tool/session drill-down,
  near-live polling, filters, required coverage wording, and developer self-view.
- Deterministic session/hour metrics with separate model, tool, merged active,
  interactive, and elapsed durations.
- Immutable hourly versions for late recalculation.
- Worker finalization for every active employee, including explicit partial
  snapshots for empty or coverage-gap hours.
- In-app connector alerts and audited CSV/text export API.

Still required:

- Wire the existing developer timeline API to an hourly-card day view.
- Add work-item, coverage, and clock-hour filters where required.
- Add export controls to the manager UI and produce a real PDF.
- Implement repeated-upload, unsupported-version, and summary-failure alerts.
- Decide whether FR-024 generated narratives are in scope. If enabled, add
  evidence links, model metadata, versioned corrections, and failure handling.
- Run the seven-day internal pilot and write its report.

## Phase 3 — incomplete

Implemented foundations:

- Organization-scoped RBAC, developer self-scope, privacy-safe schema, encrypted
  local queue, migrations, Docker images, retention of detailed events, and
  deterministic evidence links.

Still required:

- TLS and managed encryption at rest for Postgres, Redis, backups, and exports.
- Database-enforced append-only audit policy and approved support-access flow.
- Performance/load test for 50 developers and a documented p95 result.
- Availability SLO monitoring and operational metrics.
- Automated accessibility checks plus a formal WCAG 2.1 AA review.
- Production infrastructure-as-code and environment separation.
- Execute backup/restore, rollback, connector-upgrade, incident, and DR drills.
- Package and sign macOS/Windows connectors and use OS keychain storage.

## Gates that code cannot complete

The following must not be marked complete without external evidence:

- Legal/HR approval and jurisdiction review.
- Provider plan/licensing and enterprise-token validation.
- A real seven-day pilot.
- Production TLS/KMS, availability evidence, and cloud DR execution.
- Formal security and accessibility assessments.

Use `docs/ops/runbook.md` for the local operational baseline and
`docs/pilot-report-template.md` to record the real pilot.
